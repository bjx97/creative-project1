                            I have implement the principle into a few aspects in my life and it has helped me become more forgiving and
                            accepting. What a powerful tool!"

                           about how to manage a company, big or small. The book helped me realize the reason why many businesses
                           are doing well and why numerous businesses are failing. Highly recommend!"

                            ?" to everyone! It's so simple that a child can understand. The book has reflected many people's attitude
                            and reactions towards life events. If only we can behave like Sniff and Scurry, we would dwell in the present
                            and become more successful!"

                            Do not work for money, but have money work for you! Money comes when you stopped working for it! Great book

                                          People healed from severe illness by the power of the subconcious mind?! Mind=blogging! Some texts
                                          are hard to comprehend though, but overall a great book with wonderful knowledge!"
